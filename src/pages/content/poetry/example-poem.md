Soft paws tread the hallway nightâ€”
A hush of whiskers, velvet light.
Moon-lit eyes like lanterns glow;
Where secret feline daydreams go.

She slips between the slumbered hours,
Around the corners, past the flowers,
Claiming every silent room
With graceful steps and sweet perfume.

At dawn she curls upon the bed,
A purring crown upon my head;
The night's adventure safely kept
Inside the silver heron's depth.
